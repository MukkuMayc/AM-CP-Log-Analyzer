Troubles that we faced during this project:
  Virtual environment
  Q:
  How to reinstall OS on a VM?
  A:
  1. Turn off the VM if it's runnig
  2. Select VM, go Edit settings -> remove CD/DVD drive 1 ->
  Add new device -> CD/DVD drive -> Datastore ISO File -> ISO
  -> select desired image
  3. To have time to change BIOS boot priorities for booting from
  device that have OS image (namely, CD/DVD in our case), set enough
  boot delay: got Edit settings -> VM options -> Boot options ->
  Boot delay
  4. Turn on VM, go to preferred Console (recomended is Remote Console),
  press F2 to enter BIOS, go through standard procedure of ordering
  boot devices.
  Q:
  Mouse does not work in remote console, what should be done?
  A:
  It's a problem of virtual environment, ask system administrator for help.
  Q:
  I can't turn on either turn off VM, how to fix it?
  A:
  You can only wait this problematic VM get repaired by itself, it's
  another bug of virtual environment.

  Active Directory
  Q:
  What is the correct way to set IP settings for AD controller?
  A:
  DNS server: primary 127.0.0.1, secondary 8.8.8.8
  DHCP scope: DNS server - ipv4 address of controller,
  router - default gateway
  (See domain.ps1 for example)
  Q:
  After setting AD controller, I can't log in it, but AD is could be
  reached, how to fix it?
  A:
  It's likely you have to change current DNS server to the AD controller
  IP (which is recommended to be static, btw) and turn off firewall
  completely.
  Q:
  Why changes of different IP settings using GUI sometimes are reflected in
  ipconfig command?
  A:
  It's likely to correctly apply those changes you have to close/OK/apply
  all or at some upper windows that led you to the current one.
  Q:
  How to get back internet connection after joining AD?
  A:
  See 1st question: it's likely you forgot about secondary DNS server

  Applications problems
  Q:
  How to force Internet Explorer to work normal: let it download files,
  see any website without adding to exception list etc?
  A:
  Go settings -> internet options -> uncheck enable protected mode ->
  select required boxes in custom level
  Probably after getting access to internet, you should find Chrome
  download link.
  Q:
  Native archivator does not work correctly (at least with kibana archive),
  how to fix it?
